# Elsheimy.Components.Linears

This is my implementation of the basic linear algebra problems in C#. Please feel free to relay your comments, suggestions or corrections.

This component covers:

## Matrices
* Matrix addition / subtraction.
* Matrix concatenation / shrinking / extraction.
* Matrix reduction and elimination (Gauss and Gauss-Jordan).
* Determinant calculation using Laplace Expansion method.
* Invertibility and inverses.
* Matrix mirrors.
* Matrix multiplication and powers.
* Transposes.
* Identity matrices.
* Transformation matrices.
* Projection matrices.
* Reflection matrices.
* 2D and 3D rotation matrices.
* 2D and 3D shearing matrices.
* Cloning and equality comparers.

## Vectors
* Vector addition / subtraction.
* Angel between vectors.
* Vector normalization and magnitude calculator.
* Dot product and cross product.
* Vector scaling.
* Projection onto other vectors and subspaces.

I have created raw functions that operate on Array objects and wrapped those functions inside two class objects Matrix and Vector. I have overrided some operators to make it easier for users to perform various operations.
